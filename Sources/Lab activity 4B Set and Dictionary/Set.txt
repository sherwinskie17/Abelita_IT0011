A = {a, g, d, f, c, k, j, i}

B = {b, l, m, o, c, d, f, h}

C = {h, k, j, i, c}

a. How many elements are there in set A and B?
We need to find A ∩ B (common elements in A and B).

A ∩ B = {c, d, f}

Number of elements = 3

b. How many elements are there in B that is not part of A and C?
We need to find B - (A ∪ C) (elements in B but not in A or C).

A ∪ C = {a, g, d, f, c, k, j, i, h, b}

B - (A ∪ C) = {l, m, o}

Number of elements = 3
